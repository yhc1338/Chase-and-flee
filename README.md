# Chase-and-flee
The goal of two agents is to reach an agent.
The chasing agents can move 1 grid one time. And the fleeing agent can move 2 grids one time.
The RL is used to achieve the task.
In the training process, if two agents can not reach the object in 20 times, it will be regarded as failure for training faster. But in the test process, the time can be prolong such as 100.
The result is that two agents can not reach the object in most of time as the maneuvering of object is better than two agents.
